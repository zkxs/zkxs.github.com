- crappy old Dell running pfSense acting as a wired router

## Software

- Windows 11
- [SteamVR Beta client](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4F5E-AD22-7402-2EAD)
- [Steam Link for Meta Quest](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0E2C-406B-9135-38A4)
- [VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/) for face tracking
- [OpenVR Space Calibrator (hyblocker fork)](https://github.com/hyblocker/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator) for Meta/SteamVR playspace alignment
- [OVR Lighthouse Manager](https://github.com/kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager) for base station power management
- [OpenVR Advanced Settings](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009850/OVR_Advanced_Settings/) for adjusting playspace offsets. This is paid on Steam but free on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings), so you're essentially paying to get auto updates and support the developers.
- [OVR Toolkit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068820/OVR_Toolkit/) for desktop overlay
- [fpsVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/908520/fpsVR/) for performance monitoring
